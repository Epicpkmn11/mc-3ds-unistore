# Minecraft 3DS UniStore
Minecraft 3DS UniStore repo for game customization, for the Universal Updater

If you want to have something added to the UniStore, contact me on Discord, my username is skribbler#1095. The item must not already be in the file repo (linked below), and it cannot be a world as I don't think there is a way to have worlds be installed via a UniStore.

File repo: https://archive.org/details/mc-3ds-customization-repo

Thanks to Mr.Dingus#7918 for testing (even though it failed), https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/, and the Minecraft 3DS Community and Universal-Server Discord servers for support.

Oh, here's a QR code for installation (sorry, the image is kinda big):
